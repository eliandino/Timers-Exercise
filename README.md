# Timers-Exercise
#### This repository contain the Countdown and the randomGame Exercise

## Exercise countdown

There is a function called countdown that accepts a number as a parameter 
and every 1000 milliseconds decrements the value and console.logs it. 
Once the value is 0 it should log “DONE!” and stop.

## Exercise randomGame

There is a function called randomGame that selects a random number between 0 and 1 every 1000 milliseconds 
and each time that a random number is picked, it add 1 to a counter. 
If the number is greater than .75, the timer stops and console.log the number of 
tries it took before we found a number greater than .75.
